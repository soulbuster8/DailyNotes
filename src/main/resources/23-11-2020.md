Begin vs start transaction

ACID Transaction :-

1. Due to lack of isolation, we can have muliple problems. We have multiple levels of inflight transaction :- Read Uncommitted, Read committed, Repeatable read, Serializable.

Problems if we didn't implement Isolation in correct way :- 
Dirty Reads :-  A dirty read occurs when a transaction is allowed to read data from a row that has been modified by another running transaction and not yet committed.
Lost Updates :-
Non-repeatable reads :- A nonrepeatable read occurs when a transaction reads the same row twice but gets different data each time. 
Phantoms Read phenomena :- A phantom read occurs when, in the course of a transaction, two identical queries are executed, and the collection of rows returned by
                            the second query is different from the first.
                            
Read Committed DBMS Isolation level :- Query will read only committed values.(Dirty read will not occur but non-repeatable read and phantom read will occur)
Read Uncommitted DBMS Isolation level :-  

Note :- 
1. Eventual consistency occurs both in NoSql and Sql.
