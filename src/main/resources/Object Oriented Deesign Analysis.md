1. Make sure your software does what the customer wants it to do.
2. Apply basic OO principles to add flexibility.
3. Strive for a maintainable, reusable design.


OO Principle :-
1. Encapsulate what varies.
2. Code to an interface rather than to an implementation.
3. Each class in your application should have only one reason to change.


1. Use case diagrams are the blueprints for your system.


Requirement List
Use Case diagram
Use cases
Domain analysis



Domain Analysis :- Lets put all the things which we have figured out about the system together, in a way that our customer will actually understand, This process is called
                    domain analysis.
                    

The three Qs of Architecture :-
1. Is it part of the essence of the system :- Find the essence feature of the system.
2. What the heck does it mean :- What does the particular feature really means.
3. How the "heck" do i fo it :- Place to focus our attention early on is on features that seems really hard to implement. 

The point of architecture is to reduce the risks.                    
            


Design Principles :-
1. DRY Principles
2. Open Closed Principle
3. Single Responsibility principle

Preliminary Design :- Using the candidate nouns as classes and verbs as methods.
