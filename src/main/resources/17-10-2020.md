**In-Place Sorting Algorithm**

An in-place algorithm is an algorithm that does not need an
extra space and produces an output in the same memory that 
contains the data by transforming the input 'in-place'.

ex.:- Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Heap Sort.

**Merge sort** requires O(n) extra space.

**Quick sort** uses extra space for recursive function calls.
It does not need extra space for manipulation but it needs for
recursion.  


Merge Sort vs Quick Sort :-
1. Merge sort is used  when the data structure doesn’t support random access since it works with pure sequential access
 that is forward iterators, rather than random access iterators. 
2. It is widely used for external sorting, where random access can be very, very expensive compared to sequential access.
3. Merge sort is fast in the case of a linked list.
4. The main advantage of the merge sort is its stability, the elements compared equally retain their original order.

1. Quick sort is fastest, but it is not always O(N*log N), as there are worst cases where it becomes O(N^2).
2. Quicksort is probably more effective for datasets that fit in memory. For larger data sets it proves to be
    inefficient so algorithms like merge sort are preferred in that case.
3. Quick Sort in is an in-place sort (i.e. it doesn’t require any extra storage) so it is appropriate to use it for arrays.
