**In-Place Sorting Algorithm**

An in-place algorithm is an algorithm that does not need an
extra space and produces an output in the same memory that 
contains the data by transforming the input 'in-place'.

ex.:- Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Heap Sort.

**Merge sort** requires O(n) extra space.

**Quick sort** uses extra space for recursive function calls.
It does not need extra space for manipulation but it needs for
recursion.
