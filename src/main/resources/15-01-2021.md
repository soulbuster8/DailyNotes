DAO Design Pattern :- 
DAO is used to seperate the data persistance logic in seperate layer. This way, the service does not know anything about how the low-level operations to access the database is
done. This is known as "Seperation of Logic".

Advantages of DAO pattern :-
1. While changing a persistence mechanism, service layer doesn’t even have to know where the data comes from.  For example, if you’re thinking of shifting from using MySQL 
to MongoDB, all changes are needed to be done in the DAO layer only.
2. DAO pattern emphasis on the low coupling between different components of an application. So, the View layer
    have no dependency on DAO layer and only Service layer depends on it, even that with the interfaces and not from concrete implementation.
    
    
To Model any system, we should complete the following steps :- 
1. create a SRS(Software Requirement Specifications)
2. Develop the use cases
3. Diagram the use cases
4. Model the classes
5. Model the user interface design
