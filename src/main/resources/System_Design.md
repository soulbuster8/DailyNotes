Peer to Peer Network :- A P2P network in which interconnected nodes(peers) share resources amongst each other without the use of a centralized administrative system.



Client-Server Model :- A network based on the client-server model, where individual clients request services and resources from centralized servers.

DNS Load Balancing :- It is the practice of configuring domain in the DNS such that client requests to the domain are distributed across a group of servers. A domain can 
        correspond to a website, a mail system, a print server, or another service that is made accessible via the Internet. It facilitates faster access to a domain by 
        providing several IP addresses for a single host or domain name, which routes traffic between two or more servers.
        
       
Inverted Indexing :- An inverted index is a database index storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers to its location in a table or in a document or set of documents.       

Stemming and Lemmatization both generate the root form of the inflected words. The difference is that stem might not be an actual word whereas, lemma is an actual language word.
Stemming follows an algorithm with steps to perform on the words which makes it faster. Whereas, in lemmatization, you used WordNet corpus and a corpus for stop words as well
to produce lemma which makes it slower than stemming. You also had to define a parts-of-speech to obtain the correct lemma.


Redis is an open-source, NoSQL, in-memory data structure store that is used as a database, cache, and message broker.

Connections with MYSQL :-  Systems with 16G RAM or higher max_connections=1000 is a good idea, and per-connection buffer should have good/default values while on some systems
                            we can see up to 8k max connections, but such systems usually became down in case of load spikes.
