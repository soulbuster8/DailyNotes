A system is called fail-fast if it is shut down immediately when an error occurred.  fail-safe systems are not like that. They don’t stop operating
even when a fault is occurred in the system. They continue the operation by hiding the errors.
 
Fail Fast And Fail Safe Iterators In Java :- Iterators in java give us the facility to traverse over the Collection objects. Iterators returned by the
Collection are either fail-fast in nature or fail-safe in nature. Fail-Fast iterators immediately throw ConcurrentModificationException if a collection
is modified while iterating over it. Where as Fail-Safe iterators don’t throw any exceptions if a collection is modified while iterating over it.
Because, they operate on the clone of the collection, not on the actual collection. 
 
All Collection types maintain an internal array of objects ( Object[] ) to store the elements. Fail-Fast iterators directly fetch the elements from this
array. They always consider that this internal array is not modified while iterating over its elements. To know whether the collection is modified or not,
they use an internal flag called modCount which is updated each time a collection is modified. Every time when an Iterator calls the next() method, it
checks the modCount. If it finds the modCount has been updated after this Iterator has been created, it throws ConcurrentModificationException.

All the implementations of Iterator in Collection classes are fail-fast by design except the concurrent collection classes like ConcurrentHashMap and 
CopyOnWriteArrayList.


Note :- Blocking Queue is a Queue that supports operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving and removing an element, 
    and wait for space to become available in the queue when adding an element.
