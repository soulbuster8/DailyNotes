Que:-  Can java ThreadLocal be static ?
Ans :-  Yes  we can make ThreadLocal as static.
      private static ThreadLocal<String> userSessionThreadLocal;
      
Note :- In the source code of ThreadLocal. 
       java.lang.Thread Class contains a instance variable as below. 
       ThreadLocal.ThreadLocalMap threadLocals = null;
       
       Because threadLocals variable is non-static, Every thread in a application (i.e., every instance of Thread Class) will have it's own copy of threadLocals map. Key for
       this map is, current ThreadLocal instance, and value is the value which you pass as argument to ThreadLocal.set(). When you try to fetch value as ThreadLocal.get() ,
       internally, it will fetch from the ThreadLocalMap of Current Thread.
       
       In simple terms, you are getting & setting values from/to your current Thread Object, not from/to your ThreadLocal object.
      
       
SOLID Design Pricnciples :- They help us to manage most of the software problems.
S :- Single Responsibilty principle
O :- Open Closed principle
L :- Liskov Substitution principle
I :- Interface Segregation principle
D :- Dependency Inversion principle

If we don't follow SOLID principle, we end up with tight or strong coupling of the code with many other applications. Tight coupling causes time to implement any new requirement.
 

Solid design principle :- Each class and module should focus on a single task at a time.

Interface Segregation principle :- One fat interface need to be split to many smaller and relevant interfaces so that clients can know about the interfaces that are relevant
 to them.
 
Open Closed principle :- Open for extension but closed for modifications. Any new functionality should be implemented by adding new classes, attributesand methods, instead of
 changing the current ones or existing ones.
 
Liskov Substitution principle :- Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types without replacing the functioanlity of old classes.         











Note :- In java 8, when the number of items in a hash bucket grows beyond certain threshold, content of that bucket goes from using a linked list of Entry objects to do a
 balanced binary tree.
 

Que:- How hashSet works internally :- 
Ans:- HashSet internally use hashMap to store the values. It has 4 types of constructor :-
        1. HashSet()
        2. HashSet(int capacity)
        3. HashSet(int capacity, float loadFactor)
        4. HashSet(Collection E) 


Note:- There are mainly 3 concepts which can break singleton property of a class.
1. Reflection
```
Singleton instance = Singleton.getInstance();
        Singleton ins = null;

        Constructor[] declaredConstructors = Singleton.class.getDeclaredConstructors();

        System.out.println(declaredConstructors.length);
        for(Constructor constructor: declaredConstructors) {

            constructor.setAccessible(true);
            ins = (Singleton)constructor.newInstance();

            break;
        }

        System.out.println(ins.hashCode());
        System.out.println(instance.hashCode());
```
Prevention :-  There are many ways to prevent Singleton pattern from Reflection API, but one of the best solutions is to
 throw a run-time exception in the constructor if the instance already exists. In this, we can not able to create a second instance.
            
2. Serialization :- 
Serialization can also cause breakage of singleton property of singleton classes. Serialization is used to convert an object of byte stream and save in a file or send over a 
network. Suppose you serialize an object of a singleton class. Then if you de-serialize that object it will create a new instance and hence break the singleton pattern.
```
class Singleton implements Serializable  
{ 
    // public instance initialized when loading the class 
    public static Singleton instance = new Singleton(); 
      
    private Singleton()  
    { 
        // private constructor 
    } 
} 
  
  
public class GFG  
{ 
  
    public static void main(String[] args)  
    { 
        try
        { 
            Singleton instance1 = Singleton.instance; 
            ObjectOutput out 
                = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("file.text")); 
            out.writeObject(instance1); 
            out.close(); 
      
            // deserailize from file to object 
            ObjectInput in  
                = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("file.text")); 
              
            Singleton instance2 = (Singleton) in.readObject(); 
            in.close(); 
      
            System.out.println("instance1 hashCode:- "
                                                 + instance1.hashCode()); 
            System.out.println("instance2 hashCode:- " 
                                                 + instance2.hashCode()); 
        }  
          
        catch (Exception e)  
        { 
            e.printStackTrace(); 
        } 
    } 
} 
```

prevention :- To overcome this issue, we have to implement method readResolve() method.
```
class Singleton implements Serializable  
{ 
    // public instance initialized when loading the class 
    public static Singleton instance = new Singleton(); 
      
    private Singleton()  
    { 
        // private constructor 
    } 
      
    // implement readResolve method 
    protected Object readResolve() 
    { 
        return instance; 
    } 
} 
  
public class GFG  
{ 
  
    public static void main(String[] args)  
    { 
        try
        { 
            Singleton instance1 = Singleton.instance; 
            ObjectOutput out  
                = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("file.text")); 
            out.writeObject(instance1); 
            out.close(); 
          
            // deserailize from file to object 
            ObjectInput in  
                = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("file.text")); 
            Singleton instance2 = (Singleton) in.readObject(); 
            in.close(); 
          
            System.out.println("instance1 hashCode:- "
                                           + instance1.hashCode()); 
            System.out.println("instance2 hashCode:- "
                                           + instance2.hashCode()); 
        }  
          
        catch (Exception e) 
        { 
            e.printStackTrace(); 
        } 
    } 
} 
```

3. Cloning :- Cloning is a concept to create duplicate objects. Using clone we can create copy of object. Suppose, we create clone of a singleton object, then it wil create
        a copy that is there are two instances of a singleton class, hence the class is no more singleton.
        
prevention :- override clone() method and throw an exception from clone method that is CloneNotSupportedException. Now whenever user will try to create clone of singleton 
        object, it will throw exception and hence our class remains singleton.
```

// JAVA code to explain overcome  
// cloning issue with singleton 
class SuperClass implements Cloneable 
{ 
  int i = 10; 
  
  @Override
  protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException  
  { 
    return super.clone(); 
  } 
} 
  
// Singleton class 
class Singleton extends SuperClass 
{ 
  // public instance initialized when loading the class 
  public static Singleton instance = new Singleton(); 
  
  private Singleton()  
  { 
    // private constructor 
  } 
  
  @Override
  protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException  
  { 
    throw new CloneNotSupportedException(); 
  } 
} 
  
public class GFG 
{ 
  public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException  
  { 
    Singleton instance1 = Singleton.instance; 
    Singleton instance2 = (Singleton) instance1.clone(); 
    System.out.println("instance1 hashCode:- " 
                         + instance1.hashCode()); 
    System.out.println("instance2 hashCode:- " 
                         + instance2.hashCode());  
  } 
} 
```        



Reflection Api :- Reflection is an API which is used to examine or modify the behavior of methods, classes, interfaces at runtime.
1. The required classes for reflection are provided under java.lang.reflect package.
2. Reflection gives us information about the class to which an object belongs and also the methods of that class which can be executed by using the object.
3. Through reflection we can invoke methods at runtime irrespective of the access specifier used with them.

Reflection is kind of class manipulator which can manipulate classes and everything in the class(including field, constructor, methods, private constructor, field, method also).
It is dynamic so it can slow down a program because JVM can't optimize the code.
    
 
Note :- Idempotence refers to the state of the system after the request has completed.
1.  GET, PUT, DELETE methods are idempotent but not the POST method. Methods can also have the property of "idempotence" in that (aside from error or expiration issues)
    the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request. 
    
2. HashMap stores key-value pair in Map.Entry static nested class implementation. HashMap works on hashing algorithm and uses hashCode() and equals() method in put and get methods.
3. Java TreeMap class is a red-black tree based implementation. It provides an efficient means of storing key-value pairs in sorted order. It is non synchronized.
