Apache Kafka :- It is a distributed streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines and real-time streaming applications. Like a publish-subscribe system that
                can deliver in-order, persistent messages in a scalable way. Kafka is run as a cluster comprised of one or more servers each of which is called a broker 
                and communication between the clients and the servers is done with a simple, high-performance, language agnostic TCP protocol.
                

Note :- Kafka has many applications, one of which is real-time processing. Stream is a continuous stream of data. Some form of analysis is done and we get some useful data out
        of it. In terms of kafka, real-time processing involved reading data from a topic(source), doing some analysis or transformation work, and then writing the results back
        to another topic(sink). We can use kafka stream for this
