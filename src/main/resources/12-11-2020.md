Throttling Process :- <br /> It is a process which is responsible for regulating the rate at which 
application processing is conducted, either statically or dynamically. <br/>
ex.:- In high throughput processing scenarios, in Online transactional processing(OLTP), a throttling 
controller may be embedded in application host platform to balance the application's outbound publishing
rates with its inbound consumption rates. <br/>

MD5 :- It is a hash function which will give 128 bit hash value.<br/>

Base64 :- It is a group of binary-to-text-encoding schemes that represent binary data(more specifically
a sequence of 8-bit bytes) in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 
representation.<br/>
Main task is to convert three 8-bit bytes(total of 24 bits) can therefore be represented by four
6-bit Base64 digits.<br/>
ex.:- Convert "Man" to Base 64.
ASCII value of M, a and n is 77, 97 and 110 which are the 8-bit binary values 01001101, 01100001, and
01101110. These three values are joined together into a 24-bit string,producing 010011010110000101101110.
Groups of 6 bit are converted into individual numbers from left to right, which are then converted into
their corresponding Base64 character.
value.
010011 :- T <br/>
010110 :- W <br/>
000101 :- F <br/>
101110 :- u <br/>
