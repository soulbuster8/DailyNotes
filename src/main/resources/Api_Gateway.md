Api GateWay :- It is responsible for request routing, composition and protocol translation.
                1. All requests from client will come to api gateway and then it will route to the appropriate microservice.
                2. The api gateway will often handle a request by invoking multiple microservices and aggregating the results. 
                3. It can translate b/w web protocols such as HTTP and web-socket and web-unfriendly protocols that are used internally.
                
                
                
Are we deploying api gateway and load balancer hand in hand ?
