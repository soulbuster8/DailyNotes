**Command Design Pattern**

The command pattern encapsulates a request as an object,
thereby letting us parameterize other objects with different 
requests,queue or log requests and support undoable operations.

Remote control -> Client
Stereo, Lights -> Receiver

There is a command object that encapsulates a request by binding together a set of actions
on a specific receiver. 

Parameterizing other objects with different requests in our analogy means that the button
used to turn on the lights can later be used to turn on stereo or maybe open the garage
door.   

queue or log requests, and support undoable operations means that Commandâ€™s Execute
operation can store state for reversing its effects in the Command itself. The Command
may have an added unExecute operation that reverses the effects of a previous call to
execute.It may also support logging changes so that they can be reapplied in case of a
system crash.
